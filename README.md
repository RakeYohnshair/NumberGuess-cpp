# NumberGuess-cpp
You are to create a program that will have a "hard coded" integer value. So for example you might create a variable called secretNumber and assign it the value 7 (just an example). After that you will need declare a variable to eventually hold the user's guess. You might call that variable guessNumber. You will then prompt the user to enter a "guess" number. You will use cin to get this value into your guessNumber variable. You will compare the user-entered value with your integer variable by comparing their variable names to see if they are equivalent. If they are the same you will display a message such as "You guessed correctly!"; otherwise, you will give the user a message such as "Sorry you lose!"
